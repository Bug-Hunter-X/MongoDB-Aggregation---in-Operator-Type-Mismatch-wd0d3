# MongoDB Aggregation: $in Operator Type Mismatch
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB aggregation pipelines. The issue arises from mixing data types within the `$in` array, leading to unexpected query results.

## Bug Description
The provided code snippet attempts to filter documents based on a field containing values 1, 2, or '3'. Due to the inconsistency in data types (numbers and strings), the query behaves unexpectedly.

## Solution
To rectify this, ensure that all values in the `$in` array share the same data type. This can involve type casting or modifying the data in the collection to ensure consistency.
